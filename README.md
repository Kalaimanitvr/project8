## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
### Game Implementations
1. **Riddle Puzzle**:
   - Randomly selects riddles from a predefined list and challenges the user to guess the answer.
   - **Skills**: String manipulation, dictionaries, and randomness.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```python
     def get_riddle():
         riddles = {
             "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind. What am I?": "Echo",
             "I am not alive, but I grow; I don't have lungs, but I need air. What am I?": "Fire"
         }
         question, answer = random.choice(list(riddles.items()))
         return question, answer
     ```

2. **Arithmetic Puzzle**:
   - Generates random arithmetic problems for users to solve, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   - **Skills**: Random number generation, mathematical operations, and input validation.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```python
     def generate_arithmetic():
         num1 = random.randint(1, 20)
         num2 = random.randint(1, 20)
         operation = random.choice(['+', '-', '*', '/'])
         question = f"{num1} {operation} {num2}"
         correct_answer = eval(question)
         return question, correct_answer
     ```

3. **General Knowledge Quiz**:
   - Tests the user's knowledge across categories like science and math with multiple-choice questions.
   - **Skills**: Nested dictionaries, conditionals, and random sampling.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```python
     def quiz_question(category):
         questions = {
             'Science': [("What is the chemical symbol for water?", "H2O")],
             'Math': [("What is the square root of 16?", "4")]
         }
         return random.choice(questions[category])
     ```

4. **Rock-Paper-Scissors**:
   - A classic game where the user competes against the computer.
   - **Skills**: Conditional logic, dictionaries, and randomization.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```python
     def rock_paper_scissors(user_choice, computer_choice):
         rules = {'rock': 'scissors', 'scissors': 'paper', 'paper': 'rock'}
         if user_choice == computer_choice:
             return 'Tie'
         elif rules[user_choice] == computer_choice:
             return 'User wins'
         else:
             return 'Computer wins'
     ```

5. **Word Guessing Game**:
   - Challenges users to guess a secret word by revealing correct letters one at a time.
   - **Skills**: String indexing, loops, and conditionals.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```python
     def guess_letter(word, guesses):
         output = ''.join([char if char in guesses else '_' for char in word])
         return output
     ```
